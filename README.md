# Predictive Maintenance with Multi-layer Perceptron

This project is a predictive maintenance algorithm that uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict when a machine needs maintenance, based on sensor data collected from the UCI-SECOM dataset. The algorithm also includes data cleaning techniques and exploratory data analysis to improve the accuracy of the model.

## Getting Started

To use this algorithm, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You will also need to download the UCI-SECOM dataset and save it to the same directory as the Predictive_19_12_12.ipynb file.

## Installing

There are no additional installation steps required for this algorithm, as it relies on standard Python packages such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.

## Usage

1. Open the Predictive_19_12_12.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the code cells in order, starting from the top.
3. The algorithm will load the data, clean and preprocess it, perform exploratory data analysis, and train the MLP model.
4. Once the model is trained, it will be used to predict maintenance events on the test dataset.
5. The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

This algorithm was developed by [Lucas Tomazini](https://github.com/LucasTomazini) as a project for predictive maintenance using the UCI-SECOM dataset. It was based on the work of other researchers in the field of predictive maintenance, and incorporates several data cleaning and analysis techniques to improve the accuracy of the model.
